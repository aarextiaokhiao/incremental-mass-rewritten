Post-Radiation [my version]:
- There won't be Ultra Supernovae.

Elements:
- Stronger always give +^??? without softcaps.
- Mass Upgrades always scale at ^1.25 rate.
- BH Condensers always scale at ^1.25 rate.
- Tickspeed always scale at ^1.25 rate. Also, non-bonus Tickspeed boosts are disabled.
- Tickspeed Power multiplies BHC Power.
- Cosmic Rays scale at ^1.25 rate.
- Cosmic Ray Power weakens Mass Upgrades and Star Boosters.
- Atomic Power adds Tickspeed without softcaps.
- Nullify Particle Powers' softcaps and boosts.
- Argon-18's effect is squared.
- Stars boost its effect at a reduced rate.
- Strengthen Photon Upgrade 1, but it is no longer affected by levels.
- Strengthen Gluon Upgrade 1, but it is no longer affected by levels.

Neutron Tree:
- [s5]   Tickspeed Power multiplies Star Booster power at a reduced rate. ((1/(1.25-1)+1)/(1/(1.13-1)+1))
- [sn5]  Stars boost Neutron Stars.
- [sn6]  Starting at X, Supernovae adds exponent after softcaps.
- [bs5]  W Bosons boost each other more.
- [bs6]  Neutron Stars boost Gravitons.
- [bs7]  3rd Boson Upgrades scale linear, but nothing else affects them.
- [rad1] Supernovae boosts Frequency.
- [rad2] Velocity scales at same rate as Amplitude.
- [rad3] Fermions boost Frequency.
  After unlocking Gamma.
- [rad4] Neutron Stars boost Radiation.
  After unlocking Gamma.
- [rad5] Z0 Bosons boost Radiation.
  After unlocking Gamma.
- [rad6] Strengthen Radiation Self-Boosts. ((10^log(x)^0.15)^l, scales at ^1.25 minimum.)
  After unlocking Gamma.
