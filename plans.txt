Post-Radiation [my version]:
- There won't be Meta Rank.
- There won't be Ultra Supernovae.

Elements:
- Mass Upgrades always scale at ^1.25 rate.
- Tickspeed always scale at ^1.25 rate. Also, non-bonus Tickspeed boosts are disabled.
- Tickspeed Power adds Stronger Power, but nullify Stronger Power's softcaps and boosts.
- Tickspeed Power multiplies BHC Power.
- Tickspeed Power multiplies Booster Power.
- BH Condensers always scale at ^1.25 rate.
- Cosmic Rays always scale at ^1.25 rate.
- Cosmic Ray's Power raises Tickspeed Power.
- Nullify Particle Powers' softcaps and boosts.

Neutron Tree:
- [m4]   Musclers and Boosters raise their amounts.
- [gr3]  Cosmic Ray effect softcap is removed.
