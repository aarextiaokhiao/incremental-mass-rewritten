TO-DO LIST:
1: Remaining mechanics:
	1a. Quantum Foam:
		Connectable products?
	1b. Spectra Generators:
		You get Spectra Generators by fusing from Quantum Foam resources.
		Spectra Generators generate Chroma which is used to mix for both kinds from Chroma Tree.
		Spectra Generators boost stuff by upgrades, and boosted by Exotic Matter.
	1c. Blueprint - Primordium:
		Coding with groups.
	1d. ???:
		Mirror Mechanic?
2: Zeta layer, Metaphysics from Chakra's gifts.
	2a. Fluid
	2b. Imaginary
	2c. Mirror
	2d. Strange
	2e. Muonic
3: Upgrades
	3a. Multiply Particle Powers based on original formula.
	3b. Add Neutron Condensers.
	3c. Raise Axion Levels by itself.
4: A formula which gives a bit of linear inflation, but decays in a logarithmically rate.
	(b^(x/log(x/n+1)) or x^(k/log(log(x)/n+1)+1), where n is a upgrade factor)
5:
"Should I rework early Exotic resets to start off with small mass, or let Big Rip consumes OP multiplicity boosts?
OP multiplicity boosts: m1, rp1, bh1, W+ Bosons. 
By the way "Master Bosons" will be permanent on Big Rips. And you will lose access on un-Big Rip at Zeta.
Just like a Supernova - Exotic restart, but with twists."
